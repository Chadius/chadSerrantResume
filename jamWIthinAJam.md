# Jam within a Jam within a Jam
By Chad Serrant

Jeff, Andrew, Tim and myself came together last weekend for Game Jam. The topic this time: it's not digital! We had cards, tokens and dice. It was quite a change of pace from other game jams, but it would be pretty boring otherwise. There were many newcomers to this Game Jam, too. Digital vs non-digital attracts different crowds, I guess.

The name of the game is what we wrote on the back of the cards. The name changed between Inception, Ensepshun, Inception 2: Incept Harder, Inception 2: Electric Boogaloo before Andrew chose the easiest pun graphic to represent on the back of a card. Now that's executive action!

This game is cooperative, where four players try to build a path to the goal, pick it up, and head back to the start. They must also deal with Danger, which will boot them out of the game if they or their allies cannot help. The game should last for about 15 minutes tops, depending on how much the team argues.

## Inspiration

Tim had watched the movie Inception (IMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/) for the first time on Friday, and wanted to make a game based on it. I wanted to make a cooperative game, because I never see enough of those. We banded together with Jeff and Andrew and aimed for a game where you tried to build a path and grab the MacGuffin while avoiding danger. If one person made it out with the MacGuffin, everyone won.

Add some Boston Indies in jokes, and the MacGuffin became Scott MacGuffin became the Viximo (http://viximo.com/). Buy their stuff so they don't get mad at us :)

## Crafting

One big difference between this game jam and other game jams is that we spent most of the day crafting and refining the game. Usually you spend two hours designing the game and twenty hours programming it. But this weekend we were designing and tweaking the game play up until closing time. Andrew squeezed some time on Sunday to print out cards on card stock. Iteration is awesome!

As with iteration, we had lots of time to reject ideas. This part is always fun. Limiting resources to the minimum number (four.) One idea was to give path cards unique bonuses and penalties for moving up and down. We decided to Keep It Simple and leave them blank. Jeff and Tim did not want dice and cards, so the deck served as a luck component. The Gear card probably went through the most changes and is now a risky yet necessary part of the game.

## Play testing

The nice part about fast development is that we can playtest the hell out of our game. We wound up adding personal goals because we found an optimal solution that made the game too easy. We also added a timer to force people along because otherwise the team could Discard and Draw until they have the perfect deck - the Pandemic problem, as Jeff puts it. We used to have a "Move 2" card but ultimately folded it into the Path card.

Long ago when I showed my QBasic games off to people (QBasic for life!) I learned the games I make are much easier for me than they are for them. So I wasn't surprised when we invited other people to playtest and they had various difficulties playing. One team didn't embrace teamwork and were wiped out. Another team tried the "Pandemic problem" approach but abandoned it when Personal Goals were added to the mix. Overall, teams were able to win very reliably but it was very tense throughout the game - the perfect difficulty.

## Lessons Learned

The hard part about programming a game is that it takes a while to get the prototype up and running. You can't really tweak the game or add new rules on the fly, and then you need to worry about bugs (unless you write bug-free code, like I do. Naturally.) There are no bugs when you deal with cardboard, and you get a lot more time to design and tweak your game.

Rapidly iterating a game makes it mutate very quickly. We started with a template close to the film Inception but veered away when we allowed movement in any direction. We use Secrets as currency to fend off Danger and pick up the Viximo, while in the film there is no physical Viximo to pick up - in fact they are searching for secrets.

I had a blast this weekend and can't wait for the next Game Jam like this. It was good to give my design muscles a workout for once.
